# cl-gen-moodle

Small project. Main target is to learn Rust. This tool generates a Quiz with different question types for Moodle Quiz in XML format.
To build and run it, just run 'cargo run' in the project root.

## Cross compilation for Windows and Linux

I'm developing this tool on macOS, but it is intended to run in Windows as well in the future. Rust is able to cross compile code to different targets.

### Windows

### Linux
